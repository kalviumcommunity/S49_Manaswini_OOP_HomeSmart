# HomeSmart: C++ IoT Home Automation Simulator
## Project Description: 
This project aims to create a detailed simulation of a smart home environment using C++. It will model the interactions between various Internet of Things (IoT) devices, simulating how they work together to automate and optimize home functions. The simulation will showcase device communication, automated routines, energy management, and user interactions, providing insights into smart home dynamics and potential innovations in home automation.

## Features to implement:
- Multiple IoT device types (lights, thermostats, security cameras, etc.)
- Central hub for device communication and control
- User profiles with customizable preferences
- Reporting and analytics on home automation efficiency

## Programming language: 
C++

## OOP Concepts Application:
- Classes and Objects: 
    - Device class: Base class for all IoT devices
    - Specific device classes (Light, Thermostat, Camera, etc.)
    - User class: Represents home occupants with preferences
    - Home class: Oversees the entire smart home simulation
- Encapsulation: 
    - Private member variables in each class to protect device states and user data
    - Public methods for controlled access and modification of object states
- Inheritance: 
    - Device as a base class with specific IoT devices as derived classes
- This Pointer: 
    - Used in member functions to disambiguate between parameters and class members
